Traditional indexes like the B-tree allow efficient search
Match queries
E.g., SELECT * FROM Student WHERE gpa = 2.8
Range queries
E.g., SELECT * FROM Student WHERE gpa > 2.0 and gpa < 3.0
But they are limited for other queries (e.g., spatial queries)
k-Nearest Neighbor queries
Where is the closest restaurant? (k = 1)
Ranking queries
Which are the closest hotels? (ordered by increasing distance)
